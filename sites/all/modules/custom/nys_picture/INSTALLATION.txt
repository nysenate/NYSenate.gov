INSTALLING Pictures on NYS.

The nys_picture module contains an install file which enables the other modules.
Simply enable nys_picture and the other four modules will be enabled as well.

Visit each image style edit page.
This creates the directory structure in the styles directory.
  Go to /admin/config/media/image-styles
  Easiest way is to right click on each edit link and select Open Link in New Tab.
  This loads the edit page in a new tab which creates the styles directory structure.
  This forces there to be a uniform set of image style directories matching the breakpoint groups and picture mappings.
  Some of these directories may never get a derived file placed in them. They could be clutter.
